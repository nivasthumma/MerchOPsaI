"""Mutation test for the evaluation suite — does it actually catch regressions?

A suite that reports 100/100 proves nothing on its own; it may simply not be
asserting anything. This script deliberately breaks each core safety control,
re-runs the suite, and reports which scenarios caught the break.

A mutation that NO scenario catches is a hole in the suite, not a success.

Every mutation is applied to a copy and reverted in a `finally`, so a crash
cannot leave the working tree modified.
